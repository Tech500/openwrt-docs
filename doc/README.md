# openwrt-docs
Current OpenWrt documentation directory structure

The folders/files here represent the curent (21May2015) state of the OpenWrt wiki's "doc" section. 
This is not a good way to edit/modify the information on the wiki - use the wiki's editing facility.

But it is useful to see the total waterfront of documentation files, and to consider how they fit into the three high-level Guides

* Newcomers Guide
* Experienced User Guide
* Developer Guide
