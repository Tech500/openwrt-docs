Current OpenWrt documentation directory structure

The folders/files here represent the curent (21May2015) state of the OpenWrt wiki's documentation. 
You cannot edit/modify the information on the wiki here - use the wiki's editing facility.

But it is useful to see the total waterfront of documentation files, and to consider how they fit into the three high-level Guides

* [Newcomers Guide](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/playground/newcomer)
* [Experienced User Guide](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/playground/experienced)
* [Developer Guide](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/playground/developer)

Please make comments on the [Fixing wiki.openwrt.org top-level pages](https://github.com/prplfoundation/openwrt-doc-initiative/issues/13) on Github. Thanks! -richbhanover
